Excellent. Now we do this properly and professionally.

We will follow **exact Standard DH rules**, including:

* ( Z_i ) along joint axis
* ( X_i ) as common normal
* For parallel case → drop perpendicular from previous joint center to current axis
* Origin at intersection of ( X_i ) and ( Z_i )
* Right-handed frames enforced

We will strictly use the geometry from the image you provided.

# 🔎 From Your Image (Reconfirmed)

From the diagram:

* ( Z_0 ) → Up
* ( Z_1 ) → Up
* ( Z_2 ) → Left
* ( Z_3 ) → Left
* ( Z_4 ) → Left
* ( Z_5 ) → Up
* ( Z_6 ) → Left

Now apply rules mechanically.

---

# 🔷 Row 1 (Between (Z_0) and (Z_1))

* Axes are collinear (same vertical line).
* Intersecting case.

So:

* ( a_1 = 0 )
* ( \alpha_1 = 0 )
* Offset exists along (Z_0) → ( d_1 )

---

# 🔷 Row 2 (Between (Z_1) and (Z_2))

* (Z_1) vertical
* (Z_2) horizontal left
* Perpendicular axes

Using cross product:

[
X_2 = Z_1 \times Z_2
]

That gives X₂ pointing **into page**.

So:

* ( a_2 ) = distance from (Z_1) to (Z_2) along (+X_2)
* ( d_2 = 0 )
* Rotation from (Z_1) to (Z_2) about (+X_2) is +π/2

So:

[
\alpha_2 = +\frac{\pi}{2}
]

---

# 🔷 Row 3 (Between (Z_2) and (Z_3))

* Axes parallel
* Drop perpendicular from joint 2 center to (Z_3)
* That defines (X_3)

Distance measured along (+X_3)

So:

* ( a_3 > 0 )
* ( d_3 = 0 )
* ( \alpha_3 = 0 )

---

# 🔷 Row 4 (Between (Z_3) and (Z_4))

From image:

* (Z_3) and (Z_4) are parallel
* They intersect at wrist joint location

So:

* ( a_4 = 0 )
* ( \alpha_4 = 0 )
* Offset exists along (Z_3) → ( d_4 )

---

# 🔷 Row 5 (Between (Z_4) and (Z_5))

* (Z_4) horizontal left
* (Z_5) vertical
* Perpendicular

[
X_5 = Z_4 \times Z_5
]

Gives correct direction.

Rotation from (Z_4) to (Z_5) about (+X_5) = +π/2

So:

* ( a_5 = 0 )
* ( \alpha_5 = +\frac{\pi}{2} )
* ( d_5 ) exists

---

# 🔷 Row 6 (Between (Z_5) and (Z_6))

* (Z_5) vertical
* (Z_6) horizontal left
* Perpendicular

[
X_6 = Z_5 \times Z_6
]

Rotation from (Z_5) to (Z_6) about (+X_6) = +π/2

So:

* ( a_6 = 0 )
* ( \alpha_6 = +\frac{\pi}{2} )
* ( d_6 ) exists

# ✅ FINAL DH TABLE (Strictly From Your Diagram)

[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
i & a_i & \alpha_i & d_i & \theta_i \
\hline
1 & 0   & 0                & d_1 & q_1 \
2 & a_2 & +\frac{\pi}{2}   & 0   & q_2 \
3 & a_3 & 0                & 0   & q_3 \
4 & 0   & 0                & d_4 & q_4 \
5 & 0   & +\frac{\pi}{2}   & d_5 & q_5 \
6 & 0   & +\frac{\pi}{2}   & d_6 & q_6 \
\end{array}
]

# 🔥 Why This Is Correct

* Parallel cases handled using perpendicular-drop rule
* Intersecting axes handled correctly
* α signs computed using cross-product definition
* Origins placed at intersection of (X_i) and (Z_i)
* All magnitudes positive

---

# 🚨 Important

This table matches **your diagram’s geometry**, not necessarily the industrial UR5 textbook table (which uses a slightly different frame orientation).

Both are correct if consistent.

---

If you want next, we can:

* Verify one α using vector cross product numerically
* Derive full symbolic (T_{06})
* Or now move to Forward Kinematics code using this exact table

You now have a geometrically consistent DH model.
